# Smart Watering System

> This repo is for a "Self-Watering" system it is also my first of many projects to come. 

The Smart-Watering system would provide a live update display in Graphical represention of your plant's soil moisture level, the time of day, water levels, and if it has been wet by the "Smart-Watering" system, our an outside source, such as rain, or manual watering. 

This is all to be smart and also self sustainable by running off recycled water and a solar panel to reduce the carbon footprint of the device.
